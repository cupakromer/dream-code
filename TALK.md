Talk about "Writing the Code You Wish You Had"

Rename "Dream Code"


http://vooza.com/videos/common-myths-about-software-development/


What this talk is NOT:

  * Explaining how to fall asleep and dream about code (I wish)
  * Telling you are doing it wrong (but you probably are anyways)
  * A list of _spells_ or _recipes_ about how to write better code



What this talk IS:

Telling you to:
  * **_STOP IT_**
  * Not refactor (well not really, but yeah don't refactor)
  * It's ok to throw it away
  * Things won't work, good!
  * It probably will take you longer, but FAMOUS STATUE NAME HERE (image) wasn't
  built in a day



Stop It

  * Patching code
  * Shoe horning code
  * Exerting the force grip to choke it
  * Writing the ugly code that makes you cry

  **JUST DO IT THE RIGHT WAY THE FIRST TIME**
  **THERE'S NO TIME LIKE NOW**



Throw it all away

  * Sometimes, you just need to throw it out
  * ggdG:w



Code Spikes Are Fine (Trash it)



Don't Refactor

  * Don't approach a problem with the idea of 'I can refactor it later'
    _You don't go into eating with the thought: "Oh, I'll just make a huge mess.
    I can always clean up when I'm done."_
  * Refactoring is a tool after the fact to help you tidy up
    _You DO wipe the table down after you eat, just to clean up the _tiny_ mess
    you made (if any)._
  * Use this mind set to make the code what you want, not code to what you have
  * The result: over time your project will go from the ugly duckling to swan



Take a Lesson from Java and .NET

  * Watch the play-by-plays from expert coders (see Tekpub and DAS)
  * It's okay to write code that doesn't exist
    * Eclipse and Visual Studio have a GREAT toolkit
    * We tend to forget that it is easy to create a missing method or class
    * The other languages do not as it's just a hotkey away for them



Stop Using Pseudo Code

  * Learned to do this in school
  * It is a crutch
  * It promotes poor code
  * It forces you to shoe horn and then refactor a lot later
  * It hides dependencies and objects
  * **DO** understand the purpose of what needs to be done, just code it

  * Generally, the first pass of pseudo code is high level, main concepts. This
  is the level of abstraction you want your code to be at already!!!!
  * This is ruby, our code is nearly english; just write the f'ing code.
  * When you write pseudo code, you take a general concept and then you think
  about it too much. You start planning the implementation, and you screw
  yourself.

  our methods tend to be small we have objects for things use them!


Example

  Show shoe horning the code
  Show sudo code (but really this is just a mental note about code's purpose)
  Show it written as just code (skip the sudo code step)
